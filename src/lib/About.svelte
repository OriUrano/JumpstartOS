        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            JumpstartOS was born from a simple observation: countless developers
            want to contribute to open source, but finding the right issues to
            work on is incredibly difficult. We've all been there - scrolling
            through endless GitHub repositories, trying to find something that
            matches our skills and interests.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Our mission is to bridge this gap by creating an intelligent
            matching system that connects developers with meaningful open-source
            opportunities. Whether you're a beginner looking for your first
            contribution or an experienced developer seeking new challenges,
            JumpstartOS helps you find projects where you can make a real
            impact.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            We believe that open source is the backbone of modern software
            development, and every contribution - no matter how small - makes a
            difference. By making it easier to get involved, we're helping to
            strengthen the entire open-source ecosystem.
